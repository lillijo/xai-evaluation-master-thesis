# Repeated Read of CRP paper to better understand

- definition local=where global=what
- claims:
    1. insights into, and quantify importance of concepts in the model
    2. identify and counteract Clever-Hans predictors
    3. analyze concept subspaces and their contribution to fine-grained decision making
- say it is "particularly beneficial for safety-critical applications and ML-supported investigations in the sciences"
- 


## QUESTIONS:   
1. for which uses is CRP intended? Do authors specify that it might perform subpar for simple/linear models
2. is the problem with negative relevance, class-insensitivity mentioned somewhere?
3. what exactly is said about "concepts"? Is it made clear that what they mean here are just neurons or sets of neurons?
4. which methods for finding/clustering concepts semantically do they propose explicitly
5. what are the actual measures they use for testing robustness/fidelity to the model? 
6. do they opine on the accusation that BP methods heatmaps are just showing lines and corners?
7. do they relate to research showing that heatmaps might not be the most explainable method based on user studies?
8. do they address overlapping features issues?

## ANSWERS: 
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8. according to them concepts specifically solve "what" question which is overlapping things

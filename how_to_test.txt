POSSIBLE TESTS

1. generating classes + relevance scores of most important neurons of a layer
2. generating classes + id of most highly activated neuron per layer
3. relevance scores of all (?!) neurons of a layer
3. generating classes + prediction + k most relevant neurons -> CMIsymb()
4. test just one image, activations of all neurons are datapoints?
5. train for shape, remove shape from variables, 
6. add "time component" generating factors before neuron attributions
7.

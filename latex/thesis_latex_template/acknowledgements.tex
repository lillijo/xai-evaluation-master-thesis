\subsection*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Jakob Runge, who supported to my neither very climate-informatics nor causal-inferency topic and helped me sharpen my expression and scientific notation again and again.
A huge thank you to my advisors Oana-Iuliana Popescu and Simon Markus Bing who have guided me through many frustrations and blockades and helped me narrow it down when I was getting side-tracked. 
They not only complemented each other perfectly and were always there for questions but also gave me fresh perspectives on my problems and motivated me to go the extra mile.
I owe a special thanks to the researchers at the Explainable Artificial Intelligence group of the Frauenhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institute, especially Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin, Maximilian Dreyer and Reduan Achtibat. They not only in multiple sessions accompanied me in defining a research question but also were always available for technical advice on their methods. This thesis would not have been possible if Prof. Dr. Wojciech Samek had not been interested in a joint project with the climate informatics group at TU. From that group I would also like to thank Dr. Jonas Wahl and Dr. Urmi Ninad for their contribution to the initial discussion. 
My many hours in the library were lightened up by the support of and good times spent with Hannah, who always reminded me of my thesis-life balance. Of course I also extend big thank yous to my family and all my other friends who kept me sane. 
Last, but not least, I want to thank my partner Duncan for his unconditional support, be it by taking any other worries out of my hands or by answering all my English questions. 
I could not have done this without you.

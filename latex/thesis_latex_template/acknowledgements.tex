\subsection*{Acknowledgements}

First, I would like to thank my supervisor Prof. Dr. Jakob Runge, who agreed to my not very climate-informatics or causal-inferency topic and helped me sharpen my scientific expression and notation again and again.
A huge thank you to my advisors Oana-Iuliana Popescu and Simon Markus Bing who have supported me through many frustrations and blockades. 
They not only complemented each other perfectly and were always there for questions but also gave me fresh perspectives on my problems and motivated me to go the extra mile.
I owe a special thanks to the researchers at the Explainable Artificial Intelligence group of the Frauenhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institute, especially Dr. Sebastian Lapuschkin, Maximilian Dreyer and Reduan Achtibat. They not only in many sessions accompanied me in defining a research question but also were always available for technical advice on their methods. This thesis would not have been possible if Prof. Dr. Wojciech Samek had not been interested in a joint project with the climate informatics group at TU. From that group I would also like to thank Dr. Jonas Wahl and Dr. Urmi Ninad for their contribution to the initial discussion. 
My many hours in the library were lightened up by the support and good times spent with Hannah, who helped me navigate my thesis-life balance. Of course I also extend big thank yous to my family and all my other friends who kept me sane. 
Last, but not least, I want to thank my partner Duncan for his unconditional support, be it by taking any other worries out of my hands or by answering all my English questions. 
I could not have done this without you.
